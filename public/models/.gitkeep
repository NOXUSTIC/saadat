# This folder is for storing 3D models in glTF/GLB format

Since STEP files can't be loaded directly in the browser, you need to convert your model 
to a format supported by Three.js (GLB or glTF is recommended). Place the converted model here.

Conversion can be done using tools like:
- Blender
- Autodesk FBX Converter
- Online converters like https://www.creators3d.com/online-viewer
